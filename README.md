# Udacity Nanodegree Machine Learning
# Capstone Project
## Predicting Rains in Australia

### Instalation

The project requires **Python 3.7** and the following Python libraries:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [missingno](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno)

### Code

Code is on `predict_rain.ipynb`. You will also need the dataset `weatherAUS.csv`.

### Dataset

Dataset is available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package), and it consists of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. The goal is to predict if it is going to rain tomorrow, that is, predict the target variable RainTomorrow.
